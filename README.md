# Py_Challenge_Accepted
I created this repo at my early stage of interview preparation. When I was solving challenges on HackerRank and LeetCode.
I noticed my algorithms were almost distinct from the rest of the solutions, so I wanted to share them with you.
Python it is.

All the code files found in this repository are my solutions for the python code challenge from HackerRank and LeetCode. 
I have handpicked only a few where I felt I had something new to learn. With my code, I do not intend to teach or insist on using my code. Everybody has their ways of solving a problem, and these are mine. I am aiming at being the best at Python. 
And this is how I start, there is still a long way to go, learning every day! Only the logical part of solving the challenge I write the code. The rest of it, including the initial program structure and content, were already present in the editor of HackerRank or LeetCode.
